# **Docker Project Documentation: My First Container**

## **1. Setting Up the Project Environment**

### **1.1 Create a Directory for Docker Projects**

First, create a dedicated folder for storing all your Docker projects.


`cd ~/documents mkdir docker cd docker`

This creates a `docker` directory in your `documents` folder and navigates to it.

### **1.2 Clone the Docker Example Repository**

Clone the official `welcome-to-docker` GitHub repository to have a starting point for your project.



`git clone https://github.com/docker/welcome-to-docker.git cd welcome-to-docker`

This command clones the project into a folder named `welcome-to-docker` inside your `docker` directory.

---

## **2. Understanding the Repository**

### **2.1 Review Project Files**

After cloning, let's check the files inside the repository:


`ls`

Expected files you might find:

- **Dockerfile**: This is where Docker image instructions are defined.
- **docker-compose.yml** (if exists): For managing multi-container Docker applications.
- **README.md**: This file often contains project setup, configuration, and usage instructions.

### **2.2 Check the README.md**

Open the `README.md` to understand how the project works. You can view the file contents like this:

`cat README.md`

---

## **3. Build Docker Image**

### **3.1 Ensure Docker is Installed**

Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine. You can verify by typing:


`docker --version`

This should return the Docker version currently installed.

### **3.2 Build the Docker Image from Dockerfile**

The next step is to build the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` in the project. This creates an image based on the specifications in the `Dockerfile`.

`docker build -t docker-learning .`

- `-t docker-learning`: Names the image `docker-learning`.
- `.` (dot): Tells Docker to use the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

### **3.3 Verify the Image Build**

To verify that your image was built successfully:

`docker image ls`

This will list all images, and you should see `docker-learning` in the list.

---

## **4. Run the Docker Container**

### **4.1 Start the Container**

Now that you have the Docker image, you can run it. Since the application inside the Docker container listens on port `3000`, map this port to a port on your local machine (e.g., port 8080).

`docker run -d -p 8080:3000 docker-learning`

- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 8080:3000`: Maps port 3000 in the container to port 8080 on your machine.

### **4.2 Verify Running Containers**

To check if your container is running:


`docker ps`

This will list all running containers. You should see your container listed with the port mapping.

---

## **5. Access the Application**

Once the container is running, you can access the app:

1. Open a browser and visit `http://localhost:8080`.
    
2. If the page does not load, double-check the port mapping or inspect the container logs.
    

---

## **6. Inspect the Container Logs (if needed)**

If something's not working or you want to troubleshoot, you can check the logs for more details:

`docker logs <container-id>`

Replace `<container-id>` with the ID from `docker ps`.

---

## **7. Stop the Container**

Once you're done testing or need to stop the container, use the following commands:

1. Stop the container:
    
    
    `docker stop <container-id>`
    
2. Remove the container:

    
    `docker rm <container-id>`
    

---

## **8. Push Changes to GitHub (if applicable)**

### **8.1 Initialize Git (if not done already)**

In case you want to track changes or push your work to GitHub, you can initialize a Git repository:


`git init git add . git commit -m "docker-learning"`

### **8.2 Add Remote Repository and Push Changes**

If you haven't already, add a remote repository and push your changes:


`git remote add origin https://github.com/IHaroony/docker1.git git push -u origin main`

---

## **9. Next Steps**

- **Explore Dockerfile**: Dive deeper into the `Dockerfile` to understand how images are built and learn the syntax.
- **Learn about Docker Compose**: If you plan to work with multi-container setups, explore `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Experiment with Modifying Code**: Modify the application in the repository and rebuild the image to see how changes reflect in the container.

---

## **Conclusion**

Youâ€™ve successfully:

1. Set up a Docker environment.
2. Cloned a GitHub repository.
3. Built and ran your first Docker container.
4. Learned how to troubleshoot and access the application inside the container.
